Failed to load plugin prettier: Cannot find module 'eslint-plugin-prettier'
Happened while validating /home/nemesis1346/Documents/UniversityProjects/takijunchik/react-front-end/src/index.js
This can happen for a couple of reasons:
1. The plugin name is spelled incorrectly in an ESLint configuration file (e.g. .eslintrc).
2. If ESLint is installed globally, then make sure 'eslint-plugin-prettier' is installed globally as well.
3. If ESLint is installed locally, then 'eslint-plugin-prettier' isn't installed correctly.

Consider running eslint --debug /home/nemesis1346/Documents/UniversityProjects/takijunchik/react-front-end/src/index.js from a terminal to obtain a trace about the configuration files used.
[Info  - 21:05:17] Failed to load the ESLint library for the document /home/nemesis1346/node_modules/react-redux/lib/index.js
To use ESLint for single JavaScript file install eslint globally using 'npm install -g eslint'.
If you are using yarn instead of npm set the setting `"eslint.packageManager": "yarn"`
You need to reopen VS Code after installing eslint.
