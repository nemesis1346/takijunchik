Moreover, this app facilitates the researcher the processing of data stored in eaf files. Therefore, this app process data and store it. We decided to use a strong software architecture and the latest technologies of software development for different platforms. 

We are using Google Cloud Services(such as Firebase) and Blockchain Technologies(such as Hyperledger Composer) as backend systems. Ultimately, we are using React and React Native for the UI and Redux-Thunk for Data Modeling-Middleware.
